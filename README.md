# 🗡️ Linktree.Levi
A sleek and responsive Linktree-style website, where you can showcase all your social links in one place.

## The background behind this project 💡

This was my first HTML & CSS project. I wanted to create something visually clean and elegant, just like Levi's character. The idea came from the popular [Linktree](https://linktr.ee) platform, and I wanted to replicate the core concept.

The goal was to practice layout design, responsive behavior, and get a better understanding of how to structure HTML and style elements using modern CSS techniques.

## What I learned 🧠

- How to structure HTML pages semantically
- How to apply consistent styling across elements using CSS
- How to use custom fonts from Google Fonts
- How to use Font Awesome icons for social media
- How to implement hover effects and transitions
- How to create a responsive layout with media queries

## Features ✨

- Fully responsive layout
- Custom fonts (`Open Sans` & `Poppins`)
- Font Awesome icons for social platforms
- Dark-themed minimalist UI
- Clean link hover effects
- Profile picture and branding support
